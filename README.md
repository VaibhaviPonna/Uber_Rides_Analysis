# Uber Rides Analysis

This project analyzes Uber ride data to uncover insights and trends using Python and common data science libraries. It leverages Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration and visualization.

## 📊 Project Description

The analysis includes:

- Loading and preprocessing the Uber dataset
- Visualizing key metrics such as ride frequency, pickup locations, and temporal patterns
- Drawing insights to better understand rider behavior and service demand

The dataset used is `UberDataset.csv`.

## 📁 Files

- `uber_rides_analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all data analysis steps and visualizations
- `UberDataset.csv`: The dataset used in the analysis

## 🚀 Getting Started
